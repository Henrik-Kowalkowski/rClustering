# rClustering

The goal of rClustering is to demonstrate how to generate random circular clusters and illustrate how to apply K-means and K-prototypes clustering.

## Installation

`install_github("hkowalkowski/rClustering")`

## Example

How to generate synthetic 2-d circular clusters:

```{r example}
library(rClustering)
clusts <- make_clusters(4, c_range = 20, density = 500, categorical = F, seed = 1)
```
